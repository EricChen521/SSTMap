title: Examples of SSTMap Calculations
---

The simplest way to run `SSTMap` is by using command-line tools; `run_hsa` and `run_gist` that provide site-based and grid-based calculations of solvation structure and thermodynamics. Here are some examples of running these tools on MD simulations generated by various packages.

It is assumed that an explicit solvent molecular dynamics trajectory with restrained solute has already been generated by the user in one of the MD simulation packages that are supported by [MDTraj](https://mdtraj.org) and [ParmEd](http://parmed.github.io/ParmEd/html/index.html). A repository of several test cases is available [here](https://github.com/KurtzmanLab/sstmap_test_suite) which contains short trajectories and parameters files for popular MD packages such as [Amber](http://ambermd.org/), [Charmm](https://www.charmm.org), [Desmond](https://www.deshawresearch.com/resources_desmond.html), [Gromacs](http://www.gromacs.org/), [NAMD](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/) and [OpenMM](http://openmm.org/). The following commands will perform short 
### Amber
```bash
$run_hsa -i testcase.prmtop -t testcase.nc -l ligand.pdb -s 0 -n 100 -o "testcase"

$run_gist -i testcase.prmtop -t testcase.nc -l ligand.pdb -s 0 -n 100 -d 20.0 20.0 20.0 -o "testcase"

```
