title: Examples of SSTMap Calculations
---

The simplest way to run `SSTMap` is by its command-line tools; `run_hsa` and `run_gist` that provide side-based and grid-based calculations of solvation structure and thermodynamics.

It is assumed that an explicit solvent molecular dynamics trajectory has already been generated by the user in one of the main MD simulation package.

```bash
run_hsa -i topology.top -t trajectory.traj -l casp3_ligand.pdb -f 10000 -s 0 -o casp3
run_gist -i topology.top -t trajectory.traj -l casp3_ligand.pdb -d 40 40 40 -f  10000 -s 0 -o casp3
# Replace topology.top and trajectory.traj with files corresponding 
# to the MD package used for simulation, e.g.,
# casp3.prmtop & casp3.netcdf or casp3.gro & casp3.xtc.
```

```python
import sstmap as sm
# Example 1: Run a grid-based calculation
# with all quantities.
gist = sm.GridWaterAnalysis(
        "casp3.prmtop", 
        "casp3.netcdf",
        ligand_file="casp3_ligand.pdb", 
        grid_dimensions=[40, 40, 40], 
        prefix="casp3")
gist.calculate_grid_quantities()
# Example 2: Run gist with only energy calculations.
gist.calculate_grid_quantities(energy=True)
# Example 3: Initialize gist with a grid center position.
gist = sm.GridWaterAnalysis(
        "casp3.prmtop", 
        "casp3.netcdf",
        grid_center=[35.33, 52.23, 54.96], 
        grid_dimensions=[40, 40, 40], 
        prefix="casp3")
```
