title: Examples of SSTMap Calculations
---

The simplest way to run `SSTMap` is by its command-line tools; `run_hsa` and `run_gist` that provide side-based and grid-based calculations of solvation structure and thermodynamics. Here are some examples of running these tools on MD simulations generated by various packages.

It is assumed that an explicit solvent molecular dynamics trajectory has already been generated by the user in one of the MD simulation packages that are supported by MDTraj and ParEd. The repository [sstmap_test_cases](https://github.com/KurtzmanLab/sstmap_test_cases) contains short trajectories of different systems generated by different packages, including `Amber`, `Charmm`, `Desmond`, `Gromacs`, `NAMD` and `OpenMM`. 
### Amber
```bash
$run_hsa -i testcase.prmtop -t testcase.nc -l ligand.pdb -s 0 -n 100 -o "testcase"

$run_gist -i testcase.prmtop -t testcase.nc -l ligand.pdb -s 0 -n 100 -d 20.0 20.0 20.0 -o "testcase"

```
### Charmm

### Desmond

### Gromacs

### NAMD

### OpenMM
