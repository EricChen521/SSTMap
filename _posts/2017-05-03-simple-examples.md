title: Examples of SSTMap Calculations
---

The simplest way to run `SSTMap` is by its command-line tools; `run_hsa` and `run_gist` that provide side-based and grid-based calculations of solvation structure and thermodynamics. Here are some examples of running these tools on MD simulations generated by various packages.

It is assumed that an explicit solvent molecular dynamics trajectory with restrained solute has already been generated by the user in one of the MD simulation packages that are supported by [MDTraj](mdtraj.org) and [ParmEd](http://parmed.github.io/ParmEd/html/index.html). A repository of several test cases is available [here](https://github.com/KurtzmanLab/sstmap_test_suite) that also serves to demonstrate how to run SSTMap for different MD packages, such as [Amber](http://ambermd.org/), [Charmm](www.charmm.org), [Desmond](https://www.deshawresearch.com/resources_desmond.html), [Gromacs](http://www.gromacs.org/), [NAMD](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/) and [OpenMM](http://openmm.org/). 
### Amber
```bash
$run_hsa -i testcase.prmtop -t testcase.nc -l ligand.pdb -s 0 -n 100 -o "testcase"

$run_gist -i testcase.prmtop -t testcase.nc -l ligand.pdb -s 0 -n 100 -d 20.0 20.0 20.0 -o "testcase"

```
